# ROI Operations Dashboard

This repository serves as the central hub for tracking the financial impact of my AI automation projects. By integrating **Google Gemini AI**, **Make.com**, and **Notion**, I have quantified the exact ROI generated by automating complex business workflows.

## Portfolio Impact Summary (Total)
* **Total Transactions Processed:** 175 Records (100 IDP + 75 ACI)
* **Total Time Saved:** 12 hours and 5 minutes
* **Financial Value Generated:** ₱1,027.25 (IDP ROI + ACI ROI)
* **System Efficiency:** Labor cost based on a ₱695 daily rate (₱1.45/min).

### 1. ROI Logic and Formulas for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)

> [**Technical Repository link for reference**](https://github.com/Lawrenze09/AI-Invoice-Automation-Pipeline)

To maintain transparency in value tracking, I implemented the following formulas within the Notion database to calculate the efficiency of the IDP pipeline:

#### **A. Time Saved (Mins)**
**Formula:** `if(prop("Complexity") == "High", 5, if(prop("Complexity") == "Medium", 3, 1))`

**Explanation:** This formula utilizes **Weighted Time Allocation**. In a real-world business setting, not all invoices require the same manual effort.
* **High Complexity:** Documents that are "messy," multi-page, or unstructured are estimated to take a human **5 minutes** to encode manually.
* **Medium/Low:** Simpler, standard documents are capped at **3** or **1 minute**. This ensures the "Time Saved" metric remains realistic and conservative rather than inflated.

#### **B. Value Created (PHP)**
**Formula:** `prop("Time Saved (Mins)") * 1.45`

**Explanation:** This formula converts time into a monetary value (Gross Savings).
* The rate of **₱1.45 per minute** is derived from a standard daily labor rate of **₱695**.
* **Calculation:** $$695 \text{ daily rate} \div 8 \text{ hours} \div 60 \text{ minutes} \approx 1.45$$
* It quantifies the "shadow labor cost" the company saves for every minute the AI handles data extraction instead of a human employee.

#### **C. Net ROI (PHP)**
**Formula:** `prop("Value Created (PHP)") - 0.06`

**Explanation:** This is the most critical metric as it represents the **Net Profit** of the automation.
* Running the system is not free; every transaction consumes API credits from **PDF.co**, **Google Gemini**, and **Make.com**.
* I deducted **₱0.06** as the operational expense (OpEx) per record. The resulting figure is the actual value added to the business's bottom line after all technical overhead is accounted for.

### 2. ROI Logic and Formulas for Automated Customer Intelligence (ACI)

> [**Technical Repository link for reference**](https://github.com/Lawrenze09/Automated-Customer-Inquiry-System)

To maintain transparency in value tracking, I implemented the following formulas within the Notion database to calculate the efficiency of the ACI system:

#### **A. Time Saved (Mins)**
**Formula:** `if(prop("Status") == "Auto Sent", if(prop("Complexity") == "High", 15, if(prop("Complexity") == "Medium", 10, 5)), if(prop("Complexity") == "High", 7.5, if(prop("Complexity") == "Medium", 5, 2.5)) )`

**Explanation:** This formula utilizes **Conditional Efficiency Mapping** to distinguish between fully autonomous execution and **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** intervention.

#### **Baseline Complexity Levels:**
* **High Complexity (15 mins):** High-stakes tasks such as **Refunds** or **Cancellations** that require extensive verification and documentation.
* **Medium Complexity (10 mins):** Addressing **Angry Sentiment** or complex inquiries that require careful, empathetic drafting.
* **Low Complexity (5 mins):** Standard **General Inquiries** or neutral/happy feedback.

#### **Status-Based Calculation:**
* **Auto Sent (100% Savings):** When the AI meets the confidence threshold, the system claims the full baseline minutes as time saved.
* **For Review (50% Savings):** If the system flags a response for manual audit, the time saved is **divided by 2**. This realistically accounts for the time spent reviewing and refining the AI's draft, ensuring the metrics remain honest, transparent, and conservative.

#### **B. Value Created (PHP)**
**Formula:** `prop("Time Saved (Mins)") * 1.45`

**Explanation:** This formula converts the reclaimed time into gross financial savings.
* Similar to the IDP project, this uses a labor rate of **₱1.45 per minute** (derived from a ₱695 daily rate).
* **Calculation:** $$695 \text{ daily rate} \div 8 \text{ hours} \div 60 \text{ minutes} \approx 1.45$$
* It highlights the monetary value of automating high-frequency customer interactions.

#### **C. Net ROI (PHP)**
**Formula:** `prop("Value Created (PHP)") - 0.24`

**Explanation:** This represents the **Net Profit** after accounting for the system's higher operational complexity.
* The ACI pipeline is more expensive to run than IDP because it involves more "round-trips" between APIs (Gmail, Gemini, Slack, and Notion).
* I deducted **₱0.24** per transaction to cover the cumulative credit costs of the multi-module workflow. Even with this higher OpEx, the system generates significant net value by automating complex decision-making.
